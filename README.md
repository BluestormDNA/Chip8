# Chip8
Chip 8 Interpreter / Emulator

This is a Java WIP Chip8 Interpreter / Emulator mainly as an educational exercice

What has been implemented:
My basic approach to the architecture of the emulator and the interpreter.
A rom loader.
A swing window to see something (doh!)
CPU stack, stackpointer, registers and a handful of cpu opcodes for fetch decode and execution:
00EE, 1NNN, 2nnn, 3XNN, 6xkk, 7XNN, Annn, and that damn Dxyn

At the moment some games boot and draw to screen (like Pong2)
